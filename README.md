## Introduction
A web API allows for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet. Machine learning models can be deployed, hosted on a server, and interacted with through a web API. Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. In this project, I have built a web API using Flask. Through the web API, I can receive the classification of an iris flower based on the input parameters. I can also access the web API through Python and R individually. Using Flask is a great way of deploying a machine learning model and allow users to interact with it.
